## [Description](description)

The `historyDescription` meta property is used to provide a brief description of the article in the browsing history block. This block displays articles recently viewed by the user, providing quick access to previously read content. `historyDescription` complements `historyName`, providing additional context and helping users recall the content of the article.

<br/>

### [Basic Functions](basic-functions)

- **Displaying description in browsing history:** The value of `historyDescription` is displayed along with `historyName` in the browsing history block, providing a brief summary of the article's content.
- **Improving navigation:** Helps users find the necessary information faster, reminding them of the content of previously viewed articles.
- **Personalizing the experience:** Allows customization of the displayed article description in the history independently of the main article content.

### [How It Works with Other Meta Properties](with-other-properties)

- **With `historyName`:** `historyDescription` complements `historyName`, providing more complete information about the article in the browsing history block.
- **With `title` and `displayName`:** While `title` and `displayName` define the names of the article in other parts of the interface, `historyDescription` provides a specific description for the browsing history.

<br/>

### [Important Notes](notes)

- **Length:** It is recommended to be concise, usually up to 150 characters, to fully display the description in the interface without truncation.
- **Language and Style:** Use clear and simple language to effectively convey the essence of the article.

<br/>

### [Usage Tips](advice)
