# Documentation Visit History

The documentation visit history is a user interface element that displays a list of recently viewed articles or sections by the user. This feature allows for quick return to previously studied content, improving navigation and enhancing the usability of the documentation. It is located at the bottom of the page, providing easy access to past views without the need to search for them again.

```md
---
id: 1000
title: User Management in the System
displayName: User Management
order: 4
published: true
historyName: User Management
historyDescription: How to add, delete, and edit users in the system
---

# User Management in the System

This section describes methods for managing users...
```

<br/>

## [Impact of Meta Properties](impact-of-meta-properties)

- `id` defines the identifier used to retrieve `historyName` and `historyDescription` for the article.
- `historyName` specifies the article title displayed in the visit history block.
- `historyDescription` provides a brief description of the article in the visit history block.
- `published` controls the visibility of the article in all interface elements, including the visit history block. It allows hiding unpublished or temporarily
  unavailable articles without deleting them from the file structure.

## [Step-by-Step Setup Guide](step-by-step-setup-guide)

### Step 1: Adding Meta Properties to Markdown Files

For each article, add the following properties to its metadata:

- **`id`**: Unique identifier.
- **`historyName`**: Name for the visit history.
- **`historyDescription`**: Brief description for the visit history.
- **`published`**: Ensure it is set to `true`.

**Example:**

```md
---
title: Administrator's Guide
displayName: Administrator
order: 5
published: true
historyName: Administrator's Guide
historyDescription: Comprehensive guide to system management
---

# Administrator's Guide

In this section, you will find information about...
```

### Step 2: Checking the Correctness of Meta Properties

Ensure that all necessary meta properties are correctly specified and do not contain errors.

### Step 3: Generating and Testing the Site

Generate the documentation and navigate to different articles to verify the correct display.

<br/>

## [Recommendations](recommendations)

- **Conciseness and Clarity:** Write concise and clear titles and descriptions for the visit history to help users quickly understand the article content.
- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent writing style for titles and descriptions across all articles.
- **Optimal Length:** Limit the length of `historyDescription` to 120 characters to avoid text truncation in the interface.

<br/>

## [Usage examples](examples)

### Example 1: Article with custom title and description in visit history

**File `user-management.md`:**

```md
---
id: 1000
title: User Management in the System
displayName: User Management
order: 4
published: true
historyName: Users
historyDescription: How to add, delete, and edit users in the system
---

# User Management in the System

This section describes methods for managing users...
```

**Result:**

If the user has previously visited this page, the visit history block will display:

- **Users**
- _How to add, delete, and edit users in the system_

<br/>

### Example 3: Hiding an article from the visit history

**File `draft-feature.md`:**

```md
---
id: 1001
title: Draft Feature
displayName: Draft Feature
order: 10
published: false
historyName: Draft Feature
historyDescription: This feature is under development and will be available later
---

# Draft Feature

_This article is under development and will be published soon._
```

**Result:**

The article "Draft Feature" will not be displayed in the visit history block due to `published: false`, even if the user has visited this page before and it later became unpublished.
