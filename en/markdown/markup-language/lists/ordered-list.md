# Ordered Lists
This article covers ordered lists and their usage.

## Description
To create an ordered list, you need to use `(number).` at the beginning of the line. Each new list item should start with `(number).`. To create a multi-level ordered list, use 3 spaces before `(number).`, each subsequent level should be indented by a certain number of spaces multiple of 3.
