# Links
This section covers links and how to use them.

<br/>

## Description
To create a link, use the syntax:
```md
[Link text](path/to/link "Hidden link text")
```
- `Link text` is the text to display;
- `path/to/link` is the URL or relative path;
- `Hidden link text` is the text that will be displayed when hovering over the link.

If the path includes the full URL including the `http` or `https` protocols, a new browser tab will be opened,
otherwise, the navigation will occur within the current tab.

<br/>

## Usage Example
